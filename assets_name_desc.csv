E-Way Bill Solution,"<p>Introduction &ldquo;Legal Change India : GST e-Way Bill Solution from SAP&rdquo; For movement of goods across India, the India GST law provides a mechanism for generation of e-way bill number electronically, a document/number to be carried by the person-in-charge of conveyance. This E-way Bill document is generated online on the National Informatics Centre (NIC) portal for transportation of goods, both inter and intra state and includes details such as name of consignor, consignee, point of origin of consignment, consignment destination and route. Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has mandated the generation of the e-Way bill from 1st April 2018. This replaces the Way bill which was earlier required under the VAT regime. The process involves a registered tax payer generating the e-Way bill for their outward supply document on the NIC. A unique e-Way bill number (EBN) is generated for each e-Way bill and it is available to the supplier, recipient and transporter. SAP Solution E-Way Bill Solution is a comprehensive solution having control over e-way bill function. It provides a seamless and collaboration platform among stakeholders, with an audit trail and integrates with the SAP GST Compliance Solution. The solution also includes various data validation checks to ensure data accuracy which enable EWB generation without any manual intervention.</p>

Managing Positions (FK1),"<p>Position Management is a solution for facilitating a company&rsquo;s organizational management. It allows the assignment of resources that are needed in the organization, independent from actual employee assignments. Customers can maintain a target organizational structure by creating a central repository of authorized positions. A position enables the hiring of one or more employees with the specified job classification onto the position. Customers can work with positions while there are no incumbents and work with employees when they are incumbents of positions. Position Management ensures employee Job Information is consistent (the Position object drives organizational data like Department, Location, and Job Code).</p>

Prepare your custom code for S/4HANA,"<p>SAP S/4HANA is a new product line for SAP next-generation Digital Core business suite built on new architecture and data models, containing renewed applications and new UI technology (SAP Fiori). During system conversion from the classic SAP ERP system, running on any DB, to SAP S/4HANA, custom ABAP code needs to be adapted for SAP S/4HANA.</p>

Prepare your transactional data and masterdata for migration to SAP S/4HANA,"<p>When transitioning to SAP S/4HANA, you want to move over (open, unprocessed) transactional data and master data from the original source system. What you do not want to move over is old and obsolete data that is no longer required for the current business. Many analyzed SAP systems show significant transactional data backlog (at least in some application areas) and master data with low or no usage. This includes (technically) open documents that are not properly processed, they might be several years old already and irrelevant for the business. Instead of starting afresh with a new system, most new customer systems have inherited old problems.</p>

<p>Business Process Improvement functionality for age structure analysis easily helps you find old and (technically) open documents and master data. IT experts need to decide if these can be closed immediately or require a business review before closing. By doing this, you can avoid carrying unnecessary documents into SAP S/4HANA. This will immediately save you significant memory consumption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Goals:</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Get an introduction to transactional and master data cleaning before transitioning to the SAP S/4HANA solution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
