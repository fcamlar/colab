Prepare your transactional data and masterdata for migration to SAP S/4HANA,"When transitioning to SAP S/4HANA, you want to move over (open, unprocessed) transactional data and master data from the original source system. What you do not want to move over is old and obsolete data that is no longer required for the current business. Many analyzed SAP systems show significant transactional data backlog (at least in some application areas) and master data with low or no usage. This includes (technically) open documents that are not properly processed, they might be several years old already and irrelevant for the business. Instead of starting afresh with a new system, most new customer systems have inherited old problems.
Business Process Improvement functionality for age structure analysis easily helps you find old and (technically) open documents and master data. IT experts need to decide if these can be closed immediately or require a business review before closing. By doing this, you can avoid carrying unnecessary documents into SAP S/4HANA. This will immediately save you significant memory consumption.
Goals:
  Get an introduction to transactional and master data cleaning before transitioning to the SAP S/4HANA solution.
